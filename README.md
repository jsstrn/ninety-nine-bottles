# ninety-nine-bottles

The programming problem comes from the book [99 Bottles of OOP by Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles).

Create a program that outputs the lyrics to the 99 Bottles of Beer song

The song's lyrics are as follows:

> 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
> Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall...

The same verse is repeated, each time with one bottle fewer, until there is none left. The last verse is as follows:

> No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
> Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall...
